# Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience, and I had a lot of fun implementing and exploring the metrics associated to high-imbalance classification problems. My biggest takeaway is that in machine learning, the most important step is choosing the right tool for the job.  
  
In the future, I would like to revisit this project using a different dataset — ideally one where feature engineering is possible and where a longer time horizon allows for more realistic time-series cross-validation and model evaluation.
