# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project walks through the design of a Credit Card Fraud Dectection application and explores how the high class imbalance and temporal structure impact the data splitting, the evaluation metric choice, the calibration as well as the threshold selection. Our goal is not to get the best results for this data set but to give a general overview of the problem by documenting our process.  
  
We begin by some exploratory data analysis, and then take a look at a logistic regression baseline before comparing it to a more sophisticated model, a gradient boosted tree.
